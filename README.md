# WebTask
A week-long challenge and educational experience, provided by TangoCode, to learn React JS and replicate the form and function outlined through screenshots of an existing web responsive application.

##Full Disclosure
The application isn't working entirely up to specifications yet. There was a slight CSS calamity that I'm unraveling now. A valuable lesson in increments being better than iterations when learning a new technology. However, the deadline is here, so I must submit as is. React ended up being an extremely interesting and high utility new library to learn.  Regardless of the outcome, I intend to keep working on this application to keep fiddling around with React.

## Getting started
The web app is up on Heroku, so if you'd like to check the app out on your mobile devices, just head over to the following link:

```

###Want to run it yourself locally? No worries! Simply:
1. Clone the repository into a local directory.
1. Navigate to said directory on the command line, and at the root type:
      ```
      npm install
      ```
1. Once it's done installing all the necessary dependencies, simply enter the command:
      ```
      npm start
      ```
```
*Note: The first time you run the application it will probably default you to a login/signup screen. It's just a remnant of my starting attempts to learn react it's database query syntax. The authentication components are fully functional, so if you get dropped off onto the sign-in screen, just click sign-up, sign-up with a fake (but properly formatted) e-mail address and it will let you through without any hassle
```
And that's all it takes!

##Notes:
React Bootstrap is both a miracle and a curse. It was making design implementation very user friendly till I started adding components faster and noticed everything had aesthetically melted. In the mad dash to try to pin everything back where it belonged with the deadline looming I sort of filled out a textbook of rushed CSS. Additionally you might find remnants of my attempts to leverage react-redux for more consistent behavior. Although it was very interesting to construct the reducers and actions and connect components to a global state store, as the deadline grew nearer I abandoned it for more traditional props-passing logic.

And finally, regardless of how your evaluation turns out, thanks for the opportunity to interview with TangoCode. Coming in for the on-site interview and meeting the staff was one of the friendliest interview experiences I've had thus far.
