# WebTask
A week-long challenge and educational experience, provided by TangoCode, to learn React JS and replicate the form and function outlined through screenshots of an existing web responsive application.

## Getting started
The web app is up on Heroku, so if you'd like to check the app out on your mobile devices, just head over to the following link:

```

###Want to run it yourself locally? No worries! Simply:
1. Clone the repository into a local directory.
1. Navigate to said directory on the command line, and at the root type:
      ```
      npm install
      ```
1. Once it's done installing all the necessary dependencies, simply enter the command:
      ```
      npm start
      ```
##Why Isn't It There A Nice Optimized Build?
Good question! React is new for me and I wanted to dive into the code straight away so I used create-react-app, the new-ish officially supported way to create a single-page React application that requires no configuration. It uses both Webpack and Babel under the hood so you can focus on the code. When you're ready, though, you can always eject the app and gain access to the previously hidden config and build tools. I'd like to continue working on and optimizing this application, since I felt like I was a little coarse in my implementation, so I wanted to keep from ejecting just yet. If you'd prefer an optimized build, however, I can set it up.

##Notes:
Regardless of how your evaluation turns out, thanks for the opportunity to interview with TangoCode. Coming in for the on-site interview and meeting the staff was one of the friendliest interview experiences I've had thus far.
